# xkcd Native - an xkcd client for iOS
Dear Client

I am thrilled to show you the MVP for your product, as discussed.

I have considered these functions to be of value for an MVP:

- browse through the comics,
- see the comic details, including its description,
- search for comics by the comic number as well as text,
- get the comic explanation
- send comics to others

I hope you agree on my decisions. I would love to work further with you!
